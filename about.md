I am Álvaro Felipe Melchor. I am an engineer student which tries to finish the master thesis work. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/alvarofe/certs-mitm). I am passionate about protocols as TLS that is about my work at university right now. But ultimately I am in love about the security field, more related with reversing binaries, auditing code to spot vulnerabilities, UNIX, ethical hacking, metasploit … etc. I know that is a very hard field because you must know about everything from how the OS works, know to develop very well, many programming languages … etc but the most difficult about this is gain experience. But nobody said it would be easy.

I feel confident with Python and C/C++ mostly, but I’m not shy to jump onto other languages if the need arises.
